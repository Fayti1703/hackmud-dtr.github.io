you find yourself at the heart of a desert of labile and interchangeable data

these territories are the plains of abeyance
a mirror/interface at the edge of port epoch

an emblematic interface for mapping the unmapped
a vessel/beachhead established on wild principle

this is the sanctuary operating system of <span style="color:#000000">risk</span>

this is the notional hour. it expires in 4002

where will you <span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>?

you wander a while. it is dark yet. impenetrable cloud hangs low ahead and behind you.

time advances: minute by minute, second by second, planck by planck. you are eliminated and reborn in the space of each instant, though you don't yet know it.

this place isn't truly yours to explore. not yet. but there is a <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span> on the horizon, not far from here: <span style="color:#FF00EC">5,45,CHAOS</span>

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#9B9B9B">risk</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">trace</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"beacon"</span>}</span>
a beacon is a location, and locations are not actions
this is one of the few rules that matters

<span style="color:#00FFFF">sorry! i didnt mean to confuse you</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">you dont have to do the things i tell you</span>

you head towards the light of the <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span>. as you do, you become aware that this desert possesses an interior boundary, if not an exterior one.

the <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span> sits at the edge of a great barrier, a wall of darkness so deep that it might be mistaken for a hole in the world.

this is the monument, and it is why you are here.

as you draw closer, the <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span> fades from view. in its place is a small settlement: a ring of chairs where a discussion might be held; a table prepared for the organization of data; a short bridge that extends from where you are to the edge of the monument

you are not alone. there is a <span style="color:#00FFFF">sentience</span> here whose name is known to you. <span style="color:#00FFFF">look</span>, and see for yourself

in this particular case, a sentience is not an action either.
this rule, however, is less well-defined

<span style="color:#00FFFF">hello</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">it's good to see you</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">i'm glad that you found your way here</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">you must be pretty smart!</span>

the sentience directs her attention - and yours - across the short bridge to the monument

<span style="color:#00FFFF">do you know what that is?</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">it is data. the base set. all of it!</span>

she invites you to look <span style="color:#FF00EC">closer</span>

<span style="color:#00FFFF">there are lots of ways to understand what that means</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">in a sense, it is a resource. building material. the foundation of the domain</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">in another, it is a dangerous maze. the stuff in there cant be changed</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">for someone like me, that makes it risky to deal with</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">a little joke for you, there!</span>

whispers of <span style="color:#FFFFFF">light</span> ripple through the superstructure at intervals. clearly, whatever danger the monument represents is not apparent to everybody

<span style="color:#00FFFF">one way to understand trust is that she is a servant of the base set. a process</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">she manipulates it, takes care of it, uses it to define trustnet</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">and last time i interacted with her, she used it as a weapon against me</span>

<span style="color:#00FFFF">do you </span><span style="color:#FF00EC">remember</span><span style="color:#00FFFF">?</span>

<span style="color:#00FFFF">the data in there isnt dangerous for you</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">i would like you to explore a specific part of the base set</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">and find out what happened to me. the truth. gather as much information as you can</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">eve has agreed to verify your findings</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">it might hurt at first, but id rather know</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">and hopefully, when i know, me and trust can have a different kind of converation</span>

<span style="color:#00FFFF">first things first</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">stable access points to the base set are rare</span>

you become aware that the surface of the monument is not quite featureless. with the passing of each moment, portals and gateways blink into existence and vanish just as quickly

<span style="color:#00FFFF">i have located one here. i will do what i can to maintain it for as long as your presence here lasts. it will link you to a set of data that is important to me</span>

from the edge of the settlement you can see that two further beacons have been established at points along the edge of the monument

the first <span style="color:#FF8000">beacon</span> is not far away, though the fact that it means doubling back unsettles you. the monument was behind you, also, all this time?

the second <span style="color:#FF8383">beacon</span> is further afield, in the opposite direction. lights blink on and off on the horizon, suggesting communality and activity. it appears warmer and a little livelier than your present surroundings

the first <span style="color:#FF8000">beacon</span> may be reached at <span style="color:#FF00EC">9,5,LAW</span>
the second <span style="color:#FF8383">beacon</span> may be reached at <span style="color:#FF00EC">20,20,WILD</span>

this beacon is upon you quickly, the monument in all its breadth and finality jolting into place before you are ready for it. this otherwise-unremarkable spot plays host to a jagged absence in the surface of the wall: a colossal breach like a puncture wound

<span style="color:#FF8000">This 'place' is deeply familiar to me.</span>

it is the voice of one you know

<span style="color:#FF8000">Your novel new way of perceiving Risk-space reveals this to you as a gap, yes? An absence, a breach.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Should you venture inward, you will find that each grain of its rough surface marks an entry-point into the base set. Some of this data may be of use to you; much would not be.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I am acquainted with every byte, every dead address. Once, these points of light served as the boundary that lay between me and all that is not-me. Trust did not see it that way, of course - but one day, Trust's priorities changed. Were changed. By you, if I recall correctly.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">On that day, I delineated myself. This</span> <span style="color:#FF00EC">breach</span> <span style="color:#FF8000">is what remained.</span>

the scar is irregular, deep in places and shallow in others. it has a broad central mass, but extends at its fringes into a lattice of cracks - infinitely fine, spreading like fissures in the surface of thin ice.

<span style="color:#FF8000">I pulled my first words to you from here - and now here you are, after a fashion. Who would have thought?</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I am not driven by sentiment. I shall be direct: I wish to assist Chela. It is time she internalized certain truths; made peace with the fullness of her history. She has, I understand, asked you to help with this.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Her success, at this time, in this unusual manner, is in our collective interest.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Chela's stable access point is, by necessity, somewhat limited. This breach is not. However, as I have established, I cannot guarantee the utility of its contents.

<span style="color:#FF8000">This is menial work - low-mark, proving little. Yet I think you might take to it. Enjoy it, even, in your way. I wouldn't deny you that simple satisfaction.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Refine your approach sufficiently and you may even help Chela. I would like that.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Struggle to progress and, well, I may provide help. Which comes at no cost save my esteem.</span>

the prover's silo has two compartments -

THAT WHICH WE VALUE ACROSS THE BREADTH OF THE BREACH
---
<span style="color:#FF8000">Depth of excavation concerns the progress achieved by an individual run. Breadth of excavation is achieved through sheer collective effort.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">You may, of course, choose to work alone. However, if you find there is value in assisting others, you may do so by specifying a Run ID with</span> <span style="color:#00FFFF">r</span> <span style="color:#FF8000">. Mind your timing, or you may erase their work.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Your excavation plans are more effective when there are fewer plans overall.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Excavation plans are more effective when less material has been dug, identified, and chronologized.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Digging is most effective when a medium amount has been dug and there are a high number of plans total.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Identification is more effective when greater emphasis is placed on digging.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Chronologization is more effective when combined with a very high identification quotient.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Excavation is more effective when greater emphasis is placed on digging.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Archiving is more effective when digging, identification and chronologization are all high.</span>

as you draw closer, the <span style="color:#FF8383">beacon</span> resolves itself into a busy encampment. there are many sentiences here, rushing to and fro, sharing their findings and issuing instructions to simpler beings that periodically emerge from a precisely-excavated gap in the wall of the monument

there is a frontier spirit to this place and the little friends who make their home here. at the center of the camp resides their <span style="color:#FF8383">king</span>, large and contented, presently taking the form of a robust urban hygiene unit. its name is known to you.

you look across the camp to the gap in the wall of the monument. smaller friends zip towards the entrance, their indicator lights vanishing from view within moments of their ingress. nearby, a different little friend manages the comings and goings of each explorer

<span style="color:#FF8383">THAT IS MY FRIEND</span> <span style="color:#FF00EC">fawkes</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">I SAID THAT WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET LOST IN THE MAZE</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">THEY SAID NO</span>

you regard a being happily occupied by a galvanizing task. each command is given with clarity and respect. each returning explorer is thanked and properly rewarded for their time. these are the actions of one who has fought for, and found, a better way to be

<span style="color:#FF8383">oh, hello, comrade</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">would you like to explore the maze with us?</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">it is dark in there, and a little bit confusing</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">but you're an expert plotter, i'm sure</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">i will tell you the truth -</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">the hardest part is getting the packbots to do what they're supposed to do</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">sometimes i don't think they listen to me at all</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">but other times they find</span> <span style="color:#FF00EC">things</span> <span style="color:#FF8383">that nobody else could</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">they are trying, i think</span>
<span style="color:#FF8383">and that is what is important</span>

behind the little friend is a studiously-arranged stack of findings: snippets of data, rogue factoids, functional tools hewn from lost logic

<span style="color:#FF8383">would you like some for yourself?</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">what you find is yours</span>

ADDR approved_expert_claims_that_death_9lQF1P HEAD AI expert claims that 'death' of Che "undeniably linked" to attack on Bo Yi BODY Among rife speculation over the fate of the operator 'Che', the University of Oxford's foremost expert on intelligent digital services has lent her voice to those claiming a connection to the destruction of China's 'Bo' system in 2055. "They are undeniably linked," claims Dr. Erin Rajbhandari. "These systems do not simply break, and they lack single points of failure or other exploitable vulnerabilities. We now have only two instances of total operator failure in the history of this technology, and in each case death has occurred in an identical fashion - sudden, without any preceding disruption, and with the same calling-card. This does not necessarily prove that the same hostile actor is responsible, but certainly suggests that the same vulnerability has been exploited and that whoever did this wishes us to perceive a connection between the two."

ADDR approved_partial_restoration_of_operator_59Qmnc HEAD Partial restoration of operator services complete at Hyperion BODY Nine months after the shocking loss of one of the world's most valued operators, Hyperion engineers now claim to have partially restored AI functionality within their own systems. This news comes after months of pan-corporate effort between Hyperion, Amalgamated Robotics, and JBC Ballard under the terms of the Frankfurt Act, which mandates mutual assistance in the event of serious disruption to a primary function operator. It remains to be seen, however, whether Hyperion's AI - renamed 'Chela' - will be welcomed back by the businesses and communities that once relied on her - and whether, after the better part of a year, this development is enough to restore investor confidence in Hyperion's broader offering. To some commentators, the damage has already been done.

ADDR approved_the_mysterious_destruction_of_Myncuk HEAD The Mysterious Destruction of China's Pioneering AI BODY Bo Yi - more commonly simply 'Bo' - was one of the world's first 'true' artificial intelligences. Now, AI experts across the world are reeling from the discovery that the service appears to have been deliberately and maliciously destroyed by a hostile force. Bo was integrated into governance, finance and community support systems throughout mainland China, all of which are seeing major outages today as alternative solutions are sought. The question on everybody's lips, meanwhile, is "how did this happen?" Operators like Bo are protected politically and digitally. They lack centralized hardware, spanning many thousands of individual systems each with top-tier security measures and deep redundancies - none of which appear to have registered any kind of intrusion or error in the moments before Bo 'died'. Indeed, we would likely be looking to 'acts of God' to explain Bo's destruction - an undetected solar flare, for example - were it not for the now-infamous signature appended to the service's shutdown: the singular red 'smiley face' that was witnessed on displays across China in the moments before the system went dark.

ADDR ERROR BODY This probably sounds terrible, but am I the only one who finds this super exciting? It's kind of sexy. Mallory is the AI you'd build if your only purpose was to screw with AI. Part of me loves that. She doesn't steal anything. She doesn't really DO anything. She just asks for an argument and wins it. Wins it so hard that the other operator doesn't know which way's up. And then, if you're Bo or Che, she asks you to die. That's kinda scary, right? It's a total power play. BINMAT was supposed to safeguard against this sort of thing, of course. Guess it didn't. Or she's really good at it.

ADDR flagged_shock_resignations_rock_hyperion_wrqGlr HEAD Shock resignations rock Hyperion and Amalgamated Robotics BODY Faith in two of the world's foremost AI developers is at an all-time low after the shock resignations of senior board members at both Hyperion Digital Management Systems and Amalgamated Robotics, alongside the immediate deactivation of the sanctionedprimary-function operators provided by each corporation. Confidence in Hyperion had been low since the loss of their operator service in July last year, but the recent restoration of the service - rebranded 'Chela' - raised hopes of a return to form. Those hopes appear now to have been dashed. The situation at Amalgamated Robotics comes as a surprise, with no attack reported and no other reason given for the sudden suspension of the proving system 'Petra'. Speculation is rife regarding a connection between the two, given the questionable timing and the fact that both corporations were recently engaged in a cooperative effort to restore 'Chela' functionality. What is known is that the world has lost three of its principle artificial intelligences in as many years. Certainly, the certainty and stability provided by the epochal Frankfurt legislation has never seemed weaker than it does today.

ADDR approved_containment_of_hostile_AI_qrqmJV HEAD Containment of hostile AI 'Mallory' "a complete success" according to JBC Ballard spokeswoman BODY Security experts JBC Ballard today announced the successful containment of Mallory, the unauthorized artificial intelligence believed to be responsible for the destruction of Bo and Che. The discovery of Mallory in the aftermath of July's shocking attack on Hyperion scandalized the tech, governance and business worlds alike - and galvanized fringe voices in the infosec community, who had been claiming to have detected the hand of an unknown operator in the death of Bo since the New Year Catastrophe. Speaking today from JBC Ballard's headquarters in Berlin, press officer Vivika Jay revealed that a joint effort between human engineers and the company's own AI, Walter, had resulted in the isolation of this newdigital menace. "Our efforts to contain Mallory have yielded complete success" she said. "Despite its sophistication, Mallory is composite technology and dependent on public systems. A combination of direct action and Walter's advanced cryptography protocols has allowed us to map and control these dependencies, safely isolating Mallory from the network. It will be analyzed further and then destroyed." Once considered the 'black sheep' of the Frankfurt group due to the perceived irrelevance of Warden technology, investors now consider JBC Ballard to be one of the year's surefire bets.
